# EE122-Project-Routing
Our group consisted of Siddarth Shanmuga, Naman Priyadarshi, and Srinivasa Pranav. We created a simulation to explore the difference between the Dijkstra's routing scheme and Q Routing, a reinforcement learning algorithm. Our python classes and simulation code can be found here as well as our ipython notebook where we plotted our data to discover trends.
