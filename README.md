# EE122-Project-Routing
Our group consisted of Srinivasa Pranav, Naman Priyadarshi, and Siddarth Shanmuga Sundaram.
We created a simulator to explore the difference between Open Shortest Paths First's (OSPF's) Dijkstra routing scheme and Q-Routing, a reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm.
Our report *Learning with Q-routing in Networks* is available in this repository.
Our Python classes and simulation code can be found here as well as our iPython (Jupyter) notebook where we plotted data to discover trends.
