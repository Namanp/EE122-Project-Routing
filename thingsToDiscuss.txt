Q-learning is best when the network is congested and expected to be congested, not viable in sparse or “free” networks since Q-values only change when a packet comes through. When a packet comes through, then the Q-value is updated and allows for better congestion control.

Dijkstra’s with Q-learning? We started with a naive implementation where Q-values are all initialized to zero, and then it improves with our Q-learning model.
