lQ-learning is best when the network is congested and expected to be congested, not viable in sparse or “free” networks since Q-values only change when a packet comes through. When a packet comes through, then the Q-value is updated and allows for better congestion control.

Dijkstra’s with Q-learning? We started with a naive implementation where Q-values are all initialized to zero, and then it improves with our Q-learning model.

Include the network topology graph in Princeton paper

Discuss various alternatives, why Q-learning might be a preferred routing algorithm and why others might do better. 

Discuss limitations and optimizations of these methods
Our Q-routing algorithm initialized Q values as Dijkstra’s is run, but in the paper they ran it separately (this effectively gives our Q-routing algorithm a headstart unlike the one in the paper, who’s Dijkstra’s needs more time to overtake their Q-routing), might want to talk about this briefly

Discuss Full-echo


High learning rate seems to be bad so far based on our results

Discuss learning rate vs. transmit rate…any relationship based on graphs? Can do if extra time
